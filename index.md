# Introduction to Coding in Particle Physics (#introchapter)

__Mohit Srivastav__

_Work in progress_


This is an attempt at an introductory "textbook" for people entering particle physics, or even coding in general. I intend on using it for a course at Johns Hopkins University during Intersession 2024.


See below for individual chapters. You can also download:

If you have any _comments, suggestions, typo fixes_, etc.. I would be very grateful if you post them as an [**issue**](https://github.com/MohitS704/ParticleCoding/issues) or [**pull request**](https://github.com/MohitS704/ParticleCoding/pulls) in the [**GitHub repository boazbk/tcs**](https://github.com/MohitS704/ParticleCoding) where I am maintaining the source files for these notes.


Much of the formatting for this text, and the inspiration for it, comes from Boaz Barak's [*Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science*](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs).
