<blockquote>
<p><em>“Physics, which is one of the oldest academic disciplines, has
had plenty of time to figure out a way to visit the year 4515 and see if
humans are still around or have been taken over by a race of intelligent
spiders, is broken into multiple branches including particle physics and
astrophysics, neither of which has led to the construction of a
time-traveling device so who gives a shit.”</em>, <a
href="https://mathijs.info/files/ebooks/onion.pdf"><em>The Onion Book of
Known Knowledge</em></a>, 2012.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This course is intended to provide insight into how to manipulate
large quantities of data similar to a particle physicist, and how to use
the tools to do so. Now, as a PhD student who has yet to even pass his
Graduate Board Oral Exam (GBO), you may think, “Is this schmuck even
qualified to type these words??” I guess not really - but we all start
somewhere. (Pro Tip: If you think I’m wholly unqualified to be writing
this, you are probably right. <em>Please</em> help me out by suggesting
material to add or revise!) Over the course of my PhD I hope to continue
to update this text with sections about things that I <em>wish</em> I
had when I was learning to conduct analyses. This also involves pointing
you to the people who can tell you about processes better than I ever
could - the developers themselves!</p>
<p>The educational goals will be to cover the following (and this will
be updated as time goes on):</p>
<ul>
<li>An (<em>extremely</em>) brief introduction to
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>C++</li>
<li>Fortran (yes I know)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CERN ROOT</li>
<li>Pythonic methods of interfacing with CERN ROOT</li>
<li>Bypassing ROOT entirely (in some cases)</li>
<li>Speed</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="usefulness-to-physicists">Usefulness to Physicists</h2>
<p>I hope to be as helpful as possible when writing this text - but at
the end of the day - this whole text can only really be a primer.
Individual groups use specific proprietary software, collaborations like
CMS and ATLAS have their own environments, and I could not possible hope
to cover nearly all of that. I can barely manage as is! However, if
there are students who do not have strong backgrounds in programming,
texts like this can be invaluable to get them to pick up skills that
they otherwise would not have as quickly!</p>
<p>Similarly, Python is a dominant force in scientific computing, and it
gets very painful sometimes to see people still using Python 2, writing
code that is essentially not human-readable, or writing code that is
needlessly <em>slow</em>! Similarly, for those of you who are not in
particle or astrophysics, it’s sometimes not necessary to utilize
large-scale data analyses, and sometimes not necessary to learn them at
all. But, you should still learn! The ability to analyze large
quantities of data properly and efficiently also gives you the ability
to analyze small quantities of data properly and efficiently!</p>
<h2 id="usefulness-to-non-physicists">Usefulness to Non-Physicists</h2>
<p>Physicists handle large amounts of data, and if you are interested in
learning about how to analyze large amounts of data, this may be the
place for you! The same techniques and tools used by people in physics
have been used by many people (there were <a
href="https://www.casact.org/abstract/root-data-analysis-and-data-mining-tool-cern">actuaries</a>
who <em>wanted</em> to use ROOT!). I think this text can be very helpful
to anyone looking for an introduction to analyzing data.</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-documentation">The Importance of
Documentation</h2>
<p>There is a reputation among physicists that they write bad code!
“Physicist code,” it’s called - from those of us who seem “enlightened”
by studying computer science in some capacity beforehand. To be
completely honest, physicists actually don’t write code that’s bad, it’s
just hard to understand! What would truly improve the code that
physicists write would be good documentation. I’ve encountered
<em>entire</em> packages that are immensely complex, with the only
documentation being a few inline comments smattered here and there - it
isn’t sustainable!! I’m a bit of a stickler for good documentation, and
so maybe that’s why I’m bothering to write this text.</p>
<p>That being said, if you, the esteemed reader, find anything wrong
with my grammar, spelling, or have recommendations for material
<strong>please</strong> tell me! Bring up an issue on the Github or
email me at <a href="mailto:msrivas6@jh.edu">msrivas6@jhu.edu</a>.</p>
