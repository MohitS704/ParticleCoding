## Interesting Texts that I have Pulled From

Even though I am of course the smartest, most humble, and most productive Ph.D. student the world has ever seen, immune from such paltry concerns like imposter syndrome or feelings of inadequacy, I did consult other texts to write this one. While I am sure you, the reader, would have _preferred_ the unedited thoughts and obvious facts emanating from my brain, it is needless to say that this text should be supplemented by other reading - there is never a text good enough to be the end all be all!

I quite hate the culture surrounding a lot of programming circles. It often reeks of elitism, faux concern, disdain for free time, and generally reminds me of LinkedIn a little bit too much. _However_, there is a lot of good advice hidden between the swarm of recruiters and clout-chasing actors in the tech world - this is a list of those resources that I have been lucky enough to encounter during my time.

* [Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science](https://introtcs.org/public/index.html) by [Boaz Barak](https://www.boazbarak.org/)
  * This book is, apart from being the inspiration for this _obviously_ enlightening text, just a good read. It is filled with examples and is a nice deconstruction of introductory computer science theory for everything from boolean gates to computational models.

* [Code Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Complete) by [Steve McConnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_McConnell)
  * This is more of an industry book, but provided a lot of the information that I used about readability and "standards" when coding.
