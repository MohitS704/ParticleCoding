# Introduction to Coding in Particle Physics (_Work in progress_)

Mohit Srivastav

This is an __attempt__ at an introductory "textbook" for people entering data-intensive fields of physics, or even coding in general. I intend on using it for a course at Johns Hopkins University during Intersession 2024.

See below for individual chapters. You can also download:

If you have any _comments, suggestions, typo fixes_, etc., I would be very grateful if you would post them as an [__issue__](https://github.com/MohitS704/ParticleCoding/issues) or [__pull request__](https://github.com/MohitS704/ParticleCoding/pulls) in the [__GitHub repository MohitS704/ParticleCoding__](https://github.com/MohitS704/ParticleCoding) where I am maintaining the source files for these notes.

Many of the formatting choices for this text, as well as the inspiration for its existence, come from Boaz Barak's [_Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science_](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs). Go and check it out! It's a very thorough and enlightening text starting from the very basics of computational theory.
