<h2 id="warning">WARNING</h2>
<p>A lot of this chapter is filled with my opinions on this subject, based off of personal experience along with the experience of those that I know. Documentation, and the amount of effort that you put into documenting things, is entirely subjective. However, the general consensus is that you should at least document <em>something</em>.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-documentation-important">Why is Documentation Important?</h2>
<p>When code is undocumented, it can often be difficult to understand. This makes it difficult to parse for anyone in the future looking at code - <strong>including yourself!</strong> I know that many people have created a program to do something - maybe something that calculates a physical value - and when they come back to it after some time, they end up with no clue what they were thinking! This kind of blase attitude towards documentation is fine for small and self-understood scripts, but becomes much more of an issue when dealing with larger programs, and <em>especially</em> with things like packages.</p>

<p>Code is something that has to be continuously understood</p>
