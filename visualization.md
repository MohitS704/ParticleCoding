> "Mankind invented a system to cope with the fact that we are so intrinsically lousy at manipulating numbers. It's called the graph." - [Charlie Munger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger)

> "...You might think that, data presentation being almost the primary reason for ROOT's existence, it might be good at it.

Gah." - [Andy Buckley](https://www.ppe.gla.ac.uk/~abuckley/)
