# Introduction {#introchap}

>_"Beautiful is better than ugly.  
Explicit is better than implicit.  
Simple is better than complex.  
Complex is better than complicated.  
Flat is better than nested.  
Sparse is better than dense.  
Readability counts.  
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.  
Although practicality beats purity.  
Errors should never pass silently.  
Unless explicitly silenced.  
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.  
There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python#cite_note-7)  
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.  
Now is better than never.  
Although never is often better than right now.[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python#cite_note-8)  
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.  
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.  
Namespaces are one honking great idea – let's do more of those!"_

>_"We’ve heard computer science PhDs explain they were embarrassed to know Python 'because it’s a language for idiots.'"_, [Model View Culture](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/c-is-manly-python-is-for-n00bs-how-false-stereotypes-turn-into-technical-truths)


>_"If you want a fancier language, C++ is absolutely the worst one to choose. If you want real high-level, pick one that has true high-level features like garbage collection or a good system integration, rather than something that lacks both the sparseness and straightforwardness of C, and doesn't even have the high-level bindings to important concepts."_,[Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds)

  * function declarations
* Cover Recursion

## Resources to Get Started

If you do not know Python or C++, fear not! This text will not be covering *how* to code, I am assuming that you know *a priori* how to code in at least one of the two languages.
