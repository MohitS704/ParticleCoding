<p>Even though I am of course the smartest, most humble, and most productive Ph.D. student the world has ever seen, immune from such paltry concerns like imposter syndrome or feelings of inadequacy, I did consult other texts to write this one. While I am sure you, the reader, would have <em>preferred</em> the unedited thoughts and obvious facts emanating from my brain, it is needless to say that this text should be supplemented by other reading - there is never a text good enough to be the end all be all!</p>
<p>I quite hate the culture surrounding a lot of programming circles. It often reeks of elitism, faux concern, disdain for free time, and generally reminds me of LinkedIn a little bit too much. <em>However</em>, there is a lot of good advice hidden between the swarm of recruiters and clout-chasing actors in the tech world - this is a list of those resources that I have been lucky enough to encounter during my time.</p>

<li><a href="https://introtcs.org/public/index.html">Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science</a> by <a href="https://www.boazbarak.org/">Boaz Barak</a>
<ul>
<li>This book is, apart from being the inspiration for this <em>obviously</em> enlightening text, just a good read. It is filled with examples and is a nice deconstruction of introductory computer science theory for everything from boolean gates to computational models.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Complete">Code Complete</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_McConnell">Steve McConnell</a>
<ul>
<li>This is more of an industry book, but provided a lot of the information that I used about readability and “standards” when coding.</li>
